This plugin removes the nag notice at the top of WPMU plugins and themes.

== Description ==

WPMU has great themes and plugins. Unfortunately, many, if not most, come with a nag notice that admins see about installing their notifications dashboard plugin. If you've bought one plugin for your site this is probably overkill. If you're a developer you don't need this on your client's sites.

This is a simple plugin that removes the notice.  The 1.3 version has been checked against WP 4.4 and recent WPMU plugins, but still should be backwards compatible with older versions of WPMU plugins.

Note: If you do decide to you install the WPMU notifications plugin, please deactivate this one first. Errors may occur if you don't.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q:  Will this always work?
A:  It should work with all WPMU themes and plugins, but no promises, especially if they update how the notifications nag is displayed.  I'll try and update it.

Q:  How do I thank you?
A:  A little cash.  http://www.protospace.com/wpmu-no-nag-plugin/
